    <h2>1.Amish Beef and Noodle </h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">As a kid growing up in Midwestern Amish country, everyone I knew made beef and noodles. Chunks of juicy slow-cooked beef mingling with tender egg noodles in a rich broth? It’s comfort in a bowl. When I was creating my recipe, I went straight to the person who (still) makes the best beef and noodles I’ve ever had: my father. His top tips? Don’t skimp on the onion—they add so much flavor—and make sure to finish the dish with lots of freshly ground black pepper. If you're looking to make this classic Amish comfort food, read on for even more tips & tricks.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbsp. vegetable oil, divided</li>
        <li>2 lb. beef rump roast, cut into 2" cubes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 tsp. kosher salt, divided </li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper, plus more</li>
        <li>2 large yellow onions, finely chopped (about 3 c.)</li>
        <li>8 c. low-sodium beef broth, divided</li>
        <li>12 oz. wide egg noodles</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons oil. Place beef in a large bowl and toss with flour, 2 teaspoons salt, and 1/2 teaspoon pepper.  </li>
        <li>Add half of beef to pot and cook, turning occasionally, until browned on 2 sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer beef to a plate; repeat with remaining 2 tablespoons oil and beef.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium. Cook onion and 1/2 teaspoon salt, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Return beef to pot and add 6 cups broth. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until beef is tender enough to shred with a fork, 2 to 2 1/2 hours.</li>
        <li>Transfer beef to a large plate and shred with 2 forks into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Pour remaining 2 cups broth into same pot and bring to a boil. Add noodles and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, 7 to 8 minutes. Return beef to pot, toss to combine, and season with remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons salt as needed.</li>
        <li>Divide beef and noodles among bowls. Serve topped with lots of pepper.</li>
